## How do I run the app on my computer?

## What will I see in this app?

This is a TO-DO app, which allows you to create, delete and update your tasks, and mark your tasks as completed.
You'll need to sign up if you are not registered. This is because you can log in whenever you want and see your tasks even if you log out or close the tab.
